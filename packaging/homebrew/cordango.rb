# The Cordango command line, as a Homebrew formula.
#
# THIS FILE BELONGS IN `cordango/homebrew-tap`, at `Formula/cordango.rb`. It is kept here so the
# canonical copy sits beside the workflow that produces the assets it points at; copy it out on
# release, with the version and the four checksums updated from the release's SHA256SUMS.
#
# A FORMULA RATHER THAN A CASK, deliberately. A cask is for .app bundles and installers, and Homebrew
# quarantines what a cask downloads — which is why unsigned casks make people run `brew trust` before
# anything will start. A formula extracts a tarball into the Cellar and is not quarantined, so an
# unsigned binary installed this way simply runs. That is what lets this ship before there is an
# Apple Developer ID to sign with.
